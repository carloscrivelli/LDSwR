# Introduction {-}

**Data Science with R** (PSYC3012) is a 15-credit optional module that aims to develop students’ research skills relying on three main themes: Open Science, digital literacy, and science communication.

The module covers data wrangling, data visualization, categorical data analysis, general linear models, and robust statistics using R—a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Each session is grounded in Open Science best practices to favor reproducibility and transparency in science, following the guidelines of the 2019 Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the UK Reproducibility Network, and the 2016 Concordat on Open Research Data.


Upon successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

  * Recognize, explain, and apply open science best practices following the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UK Reproducibility Network guidelines.
  * Identify and describe the appropriate analytical procedures required to answer research questions related to categorical data analysis and general linear models.
  * Apply R to organize and tidy the data, to model the data, and to generate appropriate data visualizations.
  * Inspect and appraise the outputs generated with R to produce with Rmarkdown a reproducible research report that will communicate the results relying on the principles of transparency and reproducibility in science.



## How to use this book {-}

This book is intended to be the handbook of the optional module **Data Science with R** (PSYC3012); a module delivered for the Psychology undergraduate provisions at De Montfort University (Leicester, United Kingdom). This book includes all the content and reproducible examples that will be delivered in the 2-hour weekly sessions (Term 1, Academic Year 2023-24).

It is recommended to read in advance the corresponding chapters and sections that will be explained in class. Similarly, it is recommended to install **R**, **RStudio**, and the required R packages to work on the examples of this book before attending the first lecture and workshop.
